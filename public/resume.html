            I have many years’ experience working with data and data analysis – querying, visualization, reporting,
            statistical modeling, forecasting, building customized datasets, archiving, and extensive documentation.
            I work both individually and in large, highly collaborative team environments. I am a lifelong self-learner
            and an excellent communicator. I was a private evening/weekend math tutor for 22 years until I met a woman
            with whom my time was better spent (and who is now my wife). I am thorough and extremely open to finding and
            implementing the best solution to a problem even if the solution isn’t my own.
